# Model Card: FastAPI Machine Learning Model

## Overview

This model is a machine learning model deployed using FastAPI. It is trained to predict salary based on various features from the U.S. Census dataset.

## Intended Use

The intended use of this model is to predict whether an individual's salary exceeds $50,000 based on demographic and employment-related features. It can be used in applications where such predictions are required, such as targeted marketing, financial planning, or social research.

## Training Data

The model was trained on a subset of the U.S. Census dataset, consisting of demographic information such as age, education, occupation, etc., and the corresponding salary labels (<=50K or >50K).

## Evaluation Data

The model's performance was evaluated on a separate test dataset, using the following metrics:

- Precision: 0.7509
- Recall: 0.6429
- F1 Score: 0.6927

These metrics indicate the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases (those with salary >$50,000) while minimizing false positives.

## Ethical Considerations

It's important to consider potential biases in the training data and how they might impact the model's predictions. Care should be taken to ensure that the model's predictions do not disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic groups.

## Caveats and Limitations

- The model's performance may vary depending on the quality and representativeness of the training data.
- It may not generalize well to populations or contexts different from those represented in the training data.
- The model's predictions should be interpreted with caution and used as one factor among others in decision-making processes.

## Known Issues

No known issues at the time of documentation.

## Responsible Use

It's essential to use the model responsibly and consider the potential impact of its predictions on individuals and society. Careful monitoring and validation should be conducted to ensure that the model's predictions are fair, accurate, and ethical.
